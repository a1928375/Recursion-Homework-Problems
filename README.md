# Recursion-Homework-Problems

This assignment is a variety of small problems to begin you getting used to the idea of recursion. They are not full-blown interview questions, but do serve as a great start for getting your mind "in the zone" for recursion problems.

Problem 1: Write a recursive function which takes an integer and computes the cumulative sum of 0 to that integer. For example, if n=4 , return 4+3+2+1+0, which is 10.

Problem 2: Given an integer, create a function which returns the sum of all the individual digits in that integer. For example: if n = 4321, return 4+3+2+1.

Problem 3: Note, this is a more advanced problem than the previous two! It aso has a lot of variation possibilities and we're ignoring strict requirements here. Create a function called word_split() which takes in a string phrase and a set list_of_words. The function will then determine if it is possible to split the string in a way in which words can be made from the list of words. You can assume the phrase will only contain words found in the dictionary if it is completely splittable.
